## simulations

python 3.10.6 venv (can reuse same from top level)

Simulations:

* create simulations and run them (`run_simulations.sh`), e.g., locally
* this will create result files in `results/`

`python create_simulations.py`

Afterwards, analyses of these result files can be performed via `analyze.R` to generate figures in `plots/`, i.e., run `source("analyze.R")` from here.
You can obtain raw results via the following link: `https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2ql036q33ftdjoff2jv8u/simulation_results.zip?rlkey=y81yv6ynejubmrls1jfwt4qns&st=rjnh6esb&dl=0` and unzip these csvs and place them in `results/`.
